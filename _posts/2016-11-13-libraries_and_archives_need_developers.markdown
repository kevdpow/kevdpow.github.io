It's been over a month since I wrote a blog. I'm sorry. I've been dipping in and out of Learn with varying regularity. If it isn't abundantly clear, I'm a librarian (kinda) from 9-to-5, and fall is conference season (as is spring and summer; librarians LOVE conferences). I specifically work in digital preservation, which is a field that's fighting hard to preserve legacy computer stuff and contemporary computer stuff. I have a feeling preserving information will be important over the next four years. ~coughs, sips tea~

Something I heard over and over at these conferences is that ***archives and libraries need developers***. So today I'm going to make an impassioned plea for some of you who are eyeing high-paying corporate jobs to consider working in this field.

## **Fight misinformation by protecting information.**

History-keeping is needed to bolster the search for truth and meaning. It is needed to combat injustice. Why do you think the brand new [National Museum of African American History & Culture](https://nmaahc.si.edu/) is SUCH a big deal? If you're a white American, how much did you learn about African American history in school aside from slavery and the Civil Rights era? Before, between, and after those touchstones is a rich history that informs the racial injustice we talk about today. Without knowing the past and the preserving the present, how can we fight ignorance and intolerance? Activist archivists exist, and they are wonderful people. Take a look at [DocNow](http://www.docnow.io/), which is working to provide a user-friendly tool for documenting social justice movements online. 

Last week I was at the Digital Library Federation forum and the National Digital Stewardship Alliace meeting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They were convened back-to-back and included powerful keynotes by [Stacy Williams](https://youtu.be/lpFzaO0vEBg?t=27m20s) and [Bergis Jules](https://medium.com/on-archivy/confronting-our-failure-of-care-around-the-legacies-of-marginalized-people-in-the-archives-dc4180397280#.mgi9tdam5). Even if you have no familiarity with the library and archives world, I highly suggest taking a look at these two calls to action. You'll see that our field is not perfect, but there are people fighting to make it better. Saving and delivering history can be a radical act of care, and the erasure of history is an act of violence. 

## **Librarians and archivists love collaboration.**

Remember when I said librarians love conferences? There's a reason for that. We celebrate and seek out the success of others. We share our tools and our workflows. We encourage each other through administrative and project management barriers. We help each other get jobs. We work across insitutional boundaries. Specifically when it comes to coding, we work together to build tools anyone can use. Open source is (usually) the name of the game. Some neat tools developed by/for librarians and archivists:

## **Libraries and archives are (rarely) high-stress workplaces.**

Look, do we get stressed? Of course. Do projects pile up? Of course. But is the stressor a bottom line, the ROI, or massive layoffs? Rarely. Libraries encourage exploration and value innovation, which can take time. Librarians, particularly those who code, collaborate with scholars to build tools that enhance their scholarship. They build online exhibits for important/interesting collections. They make it easier for students to request off-site books. They build infrastructures for the discovery of resources.

## **Don't I need a Masters Degree, though?**

Not necessarily. I work on a floor filled with developers, not all of whom have library degrees. That said, once you have your foot in the door, a lot of libraries might actually help you get that Masters if you think it'd improve your job performance. Here is a list of recent job postings in the library field that do not require a library degree:

(There are many archivists clamoring for that last one to be filled.)

A good list to keep your eye on...

## **Final thoughts...**

Okay, I get it, you probably won't make as much money in a library or archive. But if you, like me, were shaken by last week's election results, consider contributing to this collaborative field with your newfound coding skills. We need you.
