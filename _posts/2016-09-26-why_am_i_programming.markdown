Because it's **fun**. 

When I was 10, my dad noticed that our dial-up subscription with prodigy.net (RIP) gave us space to build a website. My dad has been a programmer since the 1970s, so naturally he just picked up an HTML book from our local Barnes and Noble and started figuring it out on his own. Couple my admiration for him with my extreme nerdiness, and I couldn't help but crack open the book myself. I was blown away that you could open NotePad, edit a few lines in an `.html` file, and create a VERY COOL marquee in lime green text!!!! I was hooked. I built a silly little page on the family's site that, for #content, had some bad jokes and even worse gifs. As I grew into adolescence, I started building my own separate website for my LiveJournal icons (lol). At first the designs were rather crude, but eventually I mastered the art of image maps and even started adding CSS and PHP to my arsenal of languages.

*(ahhhhh, 2005!)*

Late nights hunched over NotePad compulsively refreshing Mozilla Firefox 1.0 dissipated as I entered college. I studied history, a true passion of mine, and worked retail, a true hatred of mine. Rather than coding until 3 AM, I spent my evenings finding *Paul Blart: Mall Cop* DVDs for grown adults (!!!!) and my nights reading 50-page articles about genocide. I didn't rediscover my love for coding until I pursued a Masters in Information Science at UT Austin (a fancy name for Library Science, just gonna be real with y'all). I took a class during my second year called Database Management where, for a final project, we built a website that queried a MySQL database. My group's site went full tilt Austin, Texas and matched craft beers with the bars that served them. Pretty useful, tbh! During my final semester I used my PHP, MySQL, CSS, and HTML skills to build a professional website from scratch that included an entire blogging/commenting structure. It was really fun! It distracted me from everything else I was *supposed* to be doing. The site is gone now. I guess I'm a bad digital archivist. 

Oh, yeah, that is the job I find myself in today. Digital preservation is pretty cool, actually. Archival collections for years and years have largely been physical objects (paper, photography, film, other ephemera) but now computer things (or born-digital material) are more and more common. It's a fun gig that has me coding every so often. I'm currently using Python to build tools that make my job easier, and once again I find myself obsessing over for-loops late into the night. I get so attached to the puzzle of it all. I look at a program and say, "I want this to do X," and then everything leading up to that final, glorious success is one long infuriating/invigorating puzzle. It's been that way since I was 10. 

So now that I'm in my [Saturn return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_return) and contemplating what to do with my life, I've decided one thing definitively: I want to code a lot more and preferably for a little cash. I don't know what that will translate into, but I decided it was worth the 12k to find out.
