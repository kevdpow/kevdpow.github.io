Hi, Everyone. 

Wow, November. What a month (I realize it's December 15th now, lol). I didn't do much coding, unfortunately. I was sooooooooooooooooooooo busy at work and I went to three conferences and to Virginia for Thanksgiving. I chipped away at HTML/CSS as best I could, but there were two weeks where I did nary a stitch of coding. 

I was kind of beating myself up about this yesterday -- what am I paying all this money for if I'd rather watch Stranger Things than a 30 minute video about CSS selectors? Then I reminded myself that I'm human, and I was busy, and it's ok, and it's gonna be fine, and the fact that it's on my mind at all is better than completely forgetting about it, and also STRANGER THINGS IS REALLY GOOD. But I digress. 

Lately one of the most helpful routes back into a coding mindset has been the [#nerdy_learn_neighbors](https://learn-co.slack.com/archives/nerdy_learn_neighbors) Slack channel. I'm on two other Slacks for different professional reasons, and to be honest I haven't quite figured out how to engage with the software. I feel like any new social media / chatting space comes with its own rules of etiquette, and until I'm comfortable with them I tread very lighty. I recently went through this process with Twitter, which for awhile was strictly a professional tool for me. Now I've about decided I can tweet anything I would say in front of my Mom. This rule, as it happens, does not preclude announcing to the world that I want Jia Tolentino's "[Notes on 21st-Century Mystic Carly Rae Jepsen](https://theawl.com/notes-on-21st-century-mystic-carly-rae-jepsen-2e4a97280ec0#.rsv6l4ivz)" read at my funeral. Anyway, I feel comfortable with Slack now, which is a good thing. The people there are really nice and encouraging. It seems they're all in different places in the program, but eager to help out others and share their experiences.  

As for pacing... eh, y'all, I don't know. I think it's one of those things I'll never master perfectly. I have a tattoo on my arm that reads "do not hurry; do not rest," which is a mantra I'm terrible at. But it's a good reminder. It's important not to overload yourself (like I did when I started Learn), but also I probably shouldn't take two weeks off because I'm tired and want to eat pizza? I'm Work feat. Drake by Rihannaing on it. 

Another key here is learning to be compassionate to myself. I'm learning to look at areas where I want to improve and not associate them with my self-worth. I did a lot of cool things in November! I got a lot done at work and hung out with my boyfriend and sang karaoke a couple times and learned how to make an excellent quinoa soup. So I think I'll be ok.

Now leave me alone while I power through Bootstrap on my way back to Ruby (I've missed you so much, Ruby!!!!!!!!)
