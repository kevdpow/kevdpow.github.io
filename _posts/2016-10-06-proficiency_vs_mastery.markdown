I picked up a few skills in my adolescence. I worked very hard at being a B-rate french horn player, I mastered the intermediate level of [Kind Lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHtd8ls4H8s) on DDR, and, as noted in my first post, I spent many hours hunched over NotePad putting together silly websites that held my angst-ridden ponderings and [Fantasia](http://web.archive.org/web/20060510045740im_/http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b391/kp1832/fan4.png) [Barrino](http://web.archive.org/web/20060510045740im_/http://godslave.isolated-dreams.net/fant.png) [icons](http://web.archive.org/web/20060510045740im_/http://i23.photobucket.com/albums/b391/kp1832/fan2.png). I was !(very cool).

For awhile, if I wanted to change a font color, I edited the style attribute for every single affected element. As you might imagine, this took awhile! My focus at the time was not exactly elegant & coherent code. I wanted shit to work and look kewl. I eventually found my way to CSS, and soon enough I was pirating stylesheets from all of my favorite websites. So today, when I jumped into [the CSS for my blog](https://github.com/kevdpow/kevdpow.github.io/tree/master/css) and messed around with colors and images, I thought fondly of the loud whir emited by my family's HP Pavilion. 

It was a fun walk down memory lane, but, to be honest, I'm actively trying to reconfigure my relationship with coding. While I worked on the Intro to Ruby track, I made an effort second-guess my first instincts. I tried to resist the urge to do whatever came to mind that would pass the test, no matter how convoluted. I want to focus on ~the journey~ rather than the destination. If I want to go from proficiency messing around with code to mastery, I have to re-evaluate my goals while I'm completing coursework. It's easy dismiss code that doesn't work, strive solely for code that does "work," and ignore any of the process in between. 

Regardless, I really like this new layout! It's very brown, which is fitting since the image is of a Brown University librarian's office in the 1910s. I really enjoy juxtaposing old imagery with new technology. For awhile my [desktop image was an iMac ad](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CqzQX8VW8AUORjY.jpg). 

Kthx that's all for now. Here's a gif my friend sent me that I cannot stop thinking about.

Thank you for being on this journey with me.
