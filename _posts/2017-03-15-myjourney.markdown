Well hello again. I'm back. 

I've been around, but now I'm back-back. Like *really* back. 

An update: my 9-to-5 has been unexpectedly bonkers since the holidays. Well, some of it was expected, but some of it really was not. I'm most comfortable when I'm busy at work, though; it feels good to have a to-do list. Buuuut then when I get off work, I'm like, "how about I watch Ken Burns documentaries and crochet until 1AM?" I stand by and defend my interests, but watching Prohibition for the fourth time is probably not a good idea if I ever want to finish Flatiron. 

I DO have a coding buddy in town now, which has helped. We've met up a couple times to encourage each other to keep going. She idenitified with my struggle to keep a regular routine. 

I'm going to try and actually block out time in my Google Calendar for coding. I'm SOOOOO close to finishing Procedural Ruby, and I'm ready to jump into OO. I know OO will be a bit of a paradigm shift which is why I'm scheduling out portions of  future weeknights for Learn.

OK that's it for now. Pray to Beyonce for me. 

<3 KP
